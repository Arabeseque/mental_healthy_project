          Only 12% of public high schools offered one of the four arts disciplines, and only 17% offered all four. It has been
          proven that students who study art are 4 times more likely to be recognized for academic achievement and 3 times more
          likely to be awarded for school attendance.

          Transparency is one of our core values, so along with using every penny you donate to supply children with the art
          supplies they need, we also prove images of each handout on our Gallery page or Social Media accounts
